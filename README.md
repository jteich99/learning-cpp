# learning-cpp
> in this repo I'm going to leave the snips of code while learning (better) cpp. I already have cpp experience, but coding within OpenFOAM, not from scratch.

1. Reading "A tour of C++" by Bjarne Sroustrup (creator of C++). Recommended for people coming from other programming languages.
2. [learncpp.com]()

## Compiling
```shell
g++-10 -std:c++20 -o <name-of-program> <source-code>.cpp
```
